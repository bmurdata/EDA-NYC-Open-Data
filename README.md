## About  
The NYC municipal workforce is one of the largest in the United States. It employs custodians, Police Officers, analysts, and much more! This raises some questions such as: 
*  How many titles are there?
*  How many unions are there?
*  How many titles are in each union?

In this notebook, we will attempt to answer these questions using the NYC Open Data Portal and Python. Google Colab and Seaborn were used.
